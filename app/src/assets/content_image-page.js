    description: <span>Described by many as the ultimate cult band, Les Rallizes D&eacute;nud&eacute;s undeniably earned a place among the very loudest, most experimental pioneers in the history of the Japanese underground. Despite a career spanning four decades, the band remains shrouded in mystery, having shunned the press, the public, and the music recording industry for the vast majority of that time.</span>
