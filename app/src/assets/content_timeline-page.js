       description: "The experimental theatre company, Gendai Gekijo, was founded in Kyoto. The group created an atmosphere of anti-commercialism and intellectualism in the Kyoto underground; enamored with French existentialism and beatnik culture, its members took to dressing in black, obscuring their faces, and refusing interviews, while sprinkling their own conversations with French slang and nihilist undertones.  Mizutani was heavily impressed by this mindset and adopted it in his personal affect as well as for his band's foundation."

      date: '1968',
       description: "Later, Gendai Gekijo helped put on the band's first public performance, contributing an arresting light show, complete with mirror balls and strobe lights. Mizutani liked it so much that he made the effects a signature of the band's shows, coining the term 'total sensory assault' to describe their goal."
