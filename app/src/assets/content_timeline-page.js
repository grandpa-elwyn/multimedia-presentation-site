        description: <span>At Doshishi University in Kyoto, 19-year-old Takeshi Mizutani formed his first band with four other students.  Their early sound was similar to the 'existenial folk' that permeated the far-left Kyoto coffe shop scene.</span>

        description: <span>The band recorded a studio demo; the result was something akin to a neutered American garage band, which horrified Mizutani.  Inspired by recent releases from the Velvet Underground and Blue Cheer, the band honed their style into one that was much louder and more distorted.</span>

       description: <span>The experimental theatre company, Gendai Gekijo, was founded in Kyoto. The group created an atmosphere of anti-commercialism and intellectualism in the Kyoto underground; enamored with French existentialism and beatnik culture, its members took to dressing in black, obscuring their faces, and refusing interviews, while sprinkling their own conversations with French slang and nihilist undertones.  Mizutani was heavily impressed by this mindset and adopted it in his personal affect as well as for his band's foundation.</span>

      date: '1968',
       description: <span>Later, Gendai Gekijo helped put on the band's first public performance, contributing an arresting light show, complete with mirror balls and strobe lights. Mizutani liked it so much that he made the effects a signature of the band's shows, coining the term 'total sensory assault' to describe their goal.</span>

      description: <span>With the line-up's addition of guitarist Fujio Yamaguchi--himself a notable figure within the Japanese underground, having fronted garage and glam-rock bands in the scene--LRD reached a new new clarity in their sound: without compromising the band's trademark weight of feedback and volume, Yamaguchi lent a more melodic, psychedelic tone to their music.  During his year-long tenure, Les Rallizes D&eacute;nud&eacute;s recorded their best-known and most highly acclaimed studio work, which was later released as MARS STUDIO 1980. </span>

    {
     date: 'Late 80s',
      description: <span>At some point later in the decade, LRD returned to the studio for a top-secret session in which they recorded only three songs, though altogether the tracks clocked in at over 40 minutes. the renditions of "night of the assassins" and "the last one" on FRANCE DEMO TAPES are among the most outstanding and unforgivably heavy versions of those songs known to be recorded.</span>
