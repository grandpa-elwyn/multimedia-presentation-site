### This is the full project code for a multimedia presentation site used for a band biography of Les Rallizes Dénudés.
###### The site is in React.js and will serve as a functioning example for the React comoponents written for it:
-Youtube video embedding  
-Audio embedding from local file or stripped from YouTube link  
-Audio visualization: shows length and levels of audio and highlights length of play completion.  Expands upon 'play' click and contacts on audio end or 'stop'  
-Window snaps to next 'page' on scroll  
###### In addition to the individually reusable modules, the entire project is very easily customizable as a multimedia presentation.  All content is inside the assets folder; fonts and color schemes for the entire project can be changed in one file.
